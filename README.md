# espMountCtrl

Mount controller written in python for `esp-mount` project. 

The project is not ready yet, and therefore you won't find any useful files in the `main` branch. To see current development stage, checkout `devel` branch.

## Installation

Installation is really simple (assuming you have `python` and `pip` installed).

1) If you don't have `pipenv` installed, install it using `pip install pipenv` (use `pip3` instead of `pip` if you are still running python 2 by default)
2) Run `pipenv install` in the source root directory. Virtual environment will be initialised and all project's dependecies installed
3) Have fun :) You can to run some of the example scripts (for example, run `pipenv run python -m espMountCtrl.examples.mountSimple`)
